My name is Gina, and in June 2021 I decided it was time for a big change.

After a decade of creating and managing social-web-email content for education nonprofits, I needed something else. I felt stuck.

I've thought about a career shift well before the COVID-19 lock down of early 2020 but the pandemic, in many ways, fueled the desire for change even more‚Äîas I imagine it did for many people with the means to make those changes or were forced by circumstance.

I gave myself one year. By June 2022 I was to have a new job, with a signed offer letter. I accomplished the switch in six months.

This is how I broke down my approach üìÖ

- 1-3 months of initial research into UX as a viable career option, including informational interviews
- 5-6 months of skill development and building my portfolio. This included bootcamps or other MOOCs and certification-style courses that were free or relatively cheap
- 4-6 months of actively looking for, interviewing, and ultimately securing an offer

Okay, that doesn‚Äôt neatly add up to 12 months but there‚Äôs some overlap in the plan.

# Exploring UX as a career üîç

When I first looked at UX as a possible career path, I focused on product design because that's the information that was readily available. There wasn't a lot of information for new UXers on research and writing as a viable entry point into UX as an industry.

Naturally, this made me a bit anxious. I had some design experience‚Äîdeveloped out of a need in my unicorn role at nonprofits‚Äîbut nothing ‚Äúprofessional.‚Äù I was also a writer, so shifting my thinking from words to shapes was new and I had doubts. Behance and Dribbble were definitely not helping with the highly polished samples.

# Bootcamps, academies, MOOCs, oh my üíª

Alternative education routes were all the rage during the pandemic. It was like everyone and their aunt had a masterclass, coaching course, certification, and so on. I enrolled in a couple of online certification courses, which I‚Äôll only mention here but if folks are interested in reading more about what those were like, let me know and I'll write a separate piece on those.

Cost was a major factor in what I ultimately decided. And time. I was working a full-time job that paid an okay salary but wasn't enough to afford a multi-week, cohort-type program like General Assembly or Springboard. I also had enough debt on my plate that I didn't want to add to it if I didn't have to. Lots of decisions to be made.

I went with this because I did their Front-End nanodegree a year prior and was satisfied with that so I figured the experience would be similar. At the time I enrolled, they were running a multi-month deal.

I enrolled in this program a few months after the Udacity ND because the content was slightly different, and I got a half scholarship that made it affordable.

# Building the portfolio üöß

This one was probably the trickiest part of the career transition. How do you convince people you‚Äôre capable in the field you‚Äôre getting into with indirect experience?

This is where things also started to shift for me.

While I learned how to create design systems, wireframes, prototypes, surveys, and tests, I stumbled across UX writing. It was a rabbit hole I fell into and I know not how I got there. Needless to say, I was _very wired_ upon discovering this as a viable UX discipline. Suddenly, the entry gate was wider.

As I continued to work through the certifications, I changed my tactic for the portfolio. Design was still important but because I didn‚Äôt have product design to showcase, I used what I had to highlight _my process in content design_. This included examples of web pages I helped lay out, information architecture and the site-map, and e-blasts I designed, along with content I wrote and why I made specific decisions. (I‚Äôll write more about specifics in another post. If you have specific questions about this, let me know.)

My portfolio was simple on purpose. I picked the top three projects I was really proud of that I thought showcased my ability to _think_ design and execute strategically, while also thinking through language, voice, tone, and all the other wordy things that live in the content realm.

And it seemed to work.

# Interviews

I applied to open roles early in my career switch process to learn about the hiring process and learn about what it‚Äôs like to be in UX generally. I also DM‚Äôd people on LinkedIn who posted about open roles to gauge whether my indirect skills would be worth considering.

This may be odd, but at this time‚Äîroughly four months into my plan‚Äîmy main objective wasn‚Äôt to land a job. It was to get information and learn how to fill the gaps I have to successfully land a job by my June 2022 deadline.

I landed a handful of interviews, some with notable companies like Mailchimp and Eventbrite.

It‚Äôs important to note that I didn‚Äôt go Wild West application spree. I was methodical about where I applied. Even though I wasn‚Äôt applying with the intent of landing a job (yet), I did apply as though I wanted the job at the companies I applied to. If I didn‚Äôt want to work at a specific place, I didn‚Äôt apply. All told, I applied to fewer than 20 open roles over the course of about 60 days‚Äîwhich might seem like a lot, but compared to the ‚Äúall or nothing‚Äù approach I‚Äôve done in the past, where I‚Äôve applied to double, even triple that, 20 is very much on the low-end.

For most of the companies I applied, I received an initial interview. I moved to the second round to even fewer. Only one came back with an offer.

I accepted and started my new role in UX as a content designer in December 2021‚Äîsix months ahead of my own schedule.
