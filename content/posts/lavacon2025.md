I'm facilitating an "escalation" workshop at this year's LavaCon with my content design colleague. Our workshop is focused on doing a hands-on content design exercise as a way to get content buy-in from our non-content partners.

[Check out the full conference program](https://www.lavacon.org/).

Use the referral code *LC2025* to get $100 off an in-person ticket.
