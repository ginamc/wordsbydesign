_April 27-May 16, 2025 - learn everything_

## Success
* **Attended IAC (Philly) and Config (San Francisco)--back to back.** I'm putting my thoughts and notes together and will do a writeup soon.
* **Started an internal podcast with a colleague.** We have a few episodes recorded and qeued in the editing bay. This should be a lot of fun.

## Working On
* **AI readiness for content designers.** It's all about the AI these days.
* Relatedly, **text pattern library and delivery.**

## Challenges
* **Deciding on whether it's worth doing these weeknotes.** I do a weekly standup with the Redwoods Community run by Ben Callahan. I'm updating the format here to reflect that one because I like it better. But maybe I just want to do these weeknotes becaues it's an easy way to fill WbD. 

_Do people read these and get anything out of them?_

## What I'm Reading
* A Philosophy of Walking by Frédéric Gros
