_Week of Jan. 6, 2025 - Laryngitis takes spotlight_

* Chronic laryngitis makes it extremely difficult to think straight. You want to participate in meetings but you can't. At least, not vocally. But listening and typing a response in real-time is very taxing--so I've learned. I don't wish this on anyone.
* Getting into the swing of things for the year. Lots of thinking and planning.

What I'm Reading
* Butter by Asako Yuzuki (translated by Polly Barton)
* Leading Content Design by Rachel McConnel
