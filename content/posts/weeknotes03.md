_Week of Jan. 27, 2025 - I was an award finalist_

* Every year, my employer holds a companywide event to kick us off for the year. It's a multiday affair that starts with a broad overview about the company and splits off into divisionals. It's a lot of content, a lot of personalities, a lot of drinking from the firehose that just won't stop. There are also lots of social activities. 
* This year was my first time attending in person. I was a finalist for one of a handful of high-level awards, so being there was a big deal. I did not win the award but a UX colleague who was a finalist in the same category clinched 1 of the 3 winning spots. Huzzah.
* Perhaps the bigger highlight is seeing everyone in the flesh.

What I'm Reading
* A Philosophy of Walking by Frédéric Gros
